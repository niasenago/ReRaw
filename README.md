This project is inspired by these 2 videos ([older one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bM3Gut1hIk ), [newer one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUWxl0WdiNI&t=326s))

## Project goals:
ReRaw focuses on two main objectives:
- Generating a sufficient amount of data samples from various file types (tbd).
- Building a neural network model to classify file types accurately.
